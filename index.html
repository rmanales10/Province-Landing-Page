            The best time to plan your Siargao trip depends on your purpose: surfing or island or beach lounging. <br> If surfing is your main agenda for traveling to Siargao, then plan your trip sometime between July <br> to November.These months are the peak surfing season in Siargao. For non-surfers, any time <br> between March to September is ideal. It is sunny, so the waters are clearer.

            The first recorded sighting by Europeans of Siargao Island was by Spanish navigator Bernardo de la Torre <br> on board of the carrack San Juan de Letrán in 1543 when attempting to <br> return from Sarangani to New Spain. It was charted as Isla de las Palmas (Palm Island in Spanish). <br>[3]In 2013, President Noynoy Aquino allocated transparent funds for the modernization of Siargao's airport, <br>the first ever modern development on the island.[4]On December 16, 2021, Typhoon Rai struck the area as a <br> Category 5 super typhoon. It left the island devastated, with many buildings damaged or demolished. <br> It caused ₱20 billion ($400 million) in damages.[5]

            Siargao Island contains one of the largest mangrove forest reserves in Mindanao, covering an area <br> of 4,871 hectares in Del Carmen.[6] Long stretches of wetlands indicate a potential for commercial <br> seaweed propagation. The extensive mangrove forests of the western coast in the Del Carmen area <br> are home to the Indo-Pacific crocodile Crocodylus porosus. A large specimen measuring <br>14 feet 9 inches (4.50 meters) was found dead in 2016 [7].Siargao Island is greatly influenced <br> by the winds and currents coming uninterrupted from the Pacific Ocean, intensified by the Mindanao <br>current running westward through the Siargao Strait. The tide of Siargao is diurnal with tidal <br> curves typically present, especially on the east coast of the island.The island's Pacific-facing reefs <br> are situated on the edge of the Philippine Trench, and the extremely deep offshore waters <br> assure the ocean swells have undiluted power when they encounter the many coral and rock <br> reefs. Siargao has excellent surfing conditions, particularly during the southwest "habagat" <br> monsoon from August to December when the prevailing wind is offshore.
